PyTalk is a Jabber Client in Python using xmpppy and PyQt4

I choose to program PyTalk to learn Qt4 and the XMPP Protocol which is the best IM protocol.

PyTalk is my Final Project to get my Degree in Computer Science from the School of Computing of the University of Portsmouth

At first, PyTalk should be jTalk a Jabber Client in Java using QtJambi. But I get in trouble with Qt Jambi and Mac OS X so I change and I take Python which is the faster way to program.
